function About() {
    return <h1>About Page</h1>;
  }
  
  export default About;
// This code defines a simple React component named "About" that renders an <h1> element with the text "About Page". It then exports this component as the default export of the module. This allows it to be imported and used in other parts of the application, such as in a router configuration or another component.
// The component can be used to display information about the application or website, typically in an "About" section. It is a common practice in React applications to create separate components for different pages or sections of the application.
// This modular approach helps in maintaining and organizing the codebase effectively.
