function Home() {
    return <h1>Home Page</h1>;
  }
  
  export default Home;
// This is a simple React component that renders a heading for the home page.
// It exports the component as the default export, allowing it to be imported and used in other parts of the application, such as in a router configuration or another component.
// The component can be used to display the main content of the application or website, typically in a "Home" section. It is a common practice in React applications to create separate components for different pages or sections of the application.
// This modular approach helps in maintaining and organizing the codebase effectively.
